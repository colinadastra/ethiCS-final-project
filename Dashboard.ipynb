    "#### One of the biggest takeaways from this project was the suprise that some schools are spending around 500,000 dollars per year on an individual student. However, even with more than 10x the funding, these schools are not performing 10x as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ultimately, policy makers need to have better information about how schools budgets are broken up. Publicly available data would be more useful if it included additonal data points regarding how the money was spent. As is, it is very difficult to authoritatively discern which factors do and do not contribute to student outcomes.\n"
